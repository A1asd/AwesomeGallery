# A Gallery Tool
Awesome Gallery (name will be changed in the future) is a tool to import image files and folders into a database and organize imported files.

Organization can happen through collections and a tagging system.

## Tags
Assign Tags to images and filter images by tags

## Collections
While you browse in Awesome Gallery (subject to change) you browse through workspaces. Workspaces consist of different kinds of views, a folder like structure like on your OS, a tag view which is fine tuned to show pictures filtered by tags and a gallery view which holds eery folder containing images and only shows those images on a buttonpress, resembling a gallery view like on your phone.

you can save your current state of your workspace in a collection resulting in a detailed bookmarking system.
